## Introduction

<div className='text-lg my-4'>
The demo below presents the hotline out of the box, with only the coordinates to draw the line. [Props](/props) can be passed
to the component / hook to customize the hotline.
</div>

import Demo from '../components/dynamics/Demo'

<Demo />

<details>
<summary className='flex items-center text-xl text-sky-400 gap-5 cursor-pointer py-2'>
	<span className="animate-bounce ml-4 h-3 w-3 rounded-full bg-sky-400 opacity-75 ring-4 ring-sky-400 ring-opacity-50"></span>
	<span>See code</span>
</summary>
```tsx filename="demo.js" {2,7-11} copy
import MapWrapper from "./map/MapWrapper";
import { Hotline } from 'react-leaflet-hotline';

export default function Demo() {
	return (
		<MapWrapper>
			<Hotline
				data={data} 
				getLat={t => t.lat} 
				getLng={t => t.lng} 
				getVal={t => t.value} />
		</MapWrapper>
	)
}
```
</details>

### Options
[Options](/options) can be passed to the `Hotline` component and the `useHotline` hook. Some options are 'tracked', 
i.e. they can be defined as a react state and changes will be reflected automatically on the hotline.
[See more](/options#tracked)

### Event handlers
[Events](/events) can be handled by the `eventHandlers` prop. Since the package is based on react-leaflet, all events supported by react-leaflet
are also supported by the hotline.  

### MultiPolyline
[MultiPolyline](/multipolyline) consists of multiple polylines grouped into one layer. They thus share the same `options` and `eventHandlers`, 
and are useful when working with multiple distinct lines that should behave similarly.

### Hook
The Hotline component is based on the [`useHotline`](/hook) hook, which is also exported and can be used in the same way as the component.
