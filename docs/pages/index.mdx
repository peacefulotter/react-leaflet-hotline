## Introduction

<div className='text-lg my-4'>
The demo below presents the hotline out of the box, with only the coordinates to draw the line. <br />
[Props](/props) can be passed to the component (and [hook](/hook)) to customize the hotline. <br />
Please see the [playground](/playground) to see the effects of changing the various props.

import MapWrapper from "./map/MapWrapper";
import { Hotline } from 'react-leaflet-hotline';

const data = [
    { lat: 55.7620299, lng: 12.5197298, value: 1 },
    { lat: 55.7598755, lng: 12.5177353, value: 8 },

export default function Demo() {
	return (
		<MapWrapper>
			<Hotline
				data={data} 
				getLat={({ point }) => point.lat}
        		getLng={({ point }) => point.lng}
        		getVal={({ point }) => point.value} />
		</MapWrapper>
	)
}

### Options
[Options](/options) can be passed to the `Hotline` component and the `useHotline` hook. Some options are 'tracked', 
i.e. they can be defined as a react state and changes will be reflected automatically on the hotline.
[See more](/options#tracked)

### Event handlers
[Events](/events) can be handled by the `eventHandlers` prop. Since the package is based on react-leaflet, all events supported by react-leaflet
are also supported by the hotline.  

### MultiPolyline
[MultiPolyline](/multipolyline) consists of multiple polylines grouped into one layer. They thus share the same `options` and `eventHandlers`, 
and are useful when working with multiple distinct lines that should behave similarly.

### Hook
The Hotline component is based on the [`useHotline`](/hook) hook, which is also exported and can be used in the same way as the component.
